	<p>I activate the Alquemical Marriage, meaning that I do work with Feminine &nbsp;and Masculine energies in balance and for the highest good.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;✠ &nbsp;I do Akashic Records readings, and Akashic Healings, as my main service.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;I do also other healing techniques, as Hands-on healing, channeling of universal force, Deeksha, Activation of chakras, &nbsp;body readings, Biodecoding, Access Counsiousness bars.</p>
	<p>I work as well, with Herbs, power plants, essential oils, minerals, and other earth elements, in order to heal the physical body symptoms, but also emotional pain, and spiritual blockages.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>I have shamanic abilities, I contact with spiritual guides and channel their messages, go to other dimensional journeys, past lives, etc. I have experience guiding people in their last moments of life, and after they passed.</p>
	<p>I am Guardian of the Sacred Fire, I do Healing Ceremonies, Talks, Workshops, &nbsp;Women's circles, and &nbsp;Menstrual Therapies.</p>
	<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ✠I give personal consultory, advisory for groups and for couples.</p>
	<p>My soul mision is to inspire people to grow as spiritual beings, in many dimentions and develop their full potential, in five main areas;&nbsp;</p>
	<h5><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;☥ Physical Body&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><em>☥ Mental&nbsp; Body&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><em>☥ Emotional Body&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><em>☥ Spiritual&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em><em>☥ Trascendental&nbsp;</em></h5>
	<p>My native language is Spanish.</p>
	<p>My service is completely professional, serious, confidential and I commit completely with the people with whom I'm sharing a healing journey.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;I do enjoy a lot serving, when one person heals, his/her surrounding is affected by that in a positive way.</p>
	<p>Part of my mission is to elevate the frequency of Gaia, and collaborate in the Ascension process. I am here to help to awaken and expand human consciousness, as well as healing humanity&rsquo;s inner wounds.</p>
